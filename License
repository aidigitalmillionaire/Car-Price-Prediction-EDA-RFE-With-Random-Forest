# Project Description ‚Äî Car Price Prediction üöó

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting car prices.  
It combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **feature selection (RFE)**, and **Random Forest Regression** to build a robust prediction model.

## Workflow
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize relationships between car attributes and prices.  
   - Identify patterns, correlations, and skewness.  

3. **Feature Selection (RFE)**  
   - Use Recursive Feature Elimination to select the most important predictors.  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Train a **Random Forest Regressor** on selected features.  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: R¬≤, MAE, MSE, RMSE  
   - Compare predicted vs actual car prices.  

## Applications
- Used car market price estimation  
- Dealership analytics  
- Price recommendation engines  
- Business decision-making for auto resale platforms
