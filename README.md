This project builds a **Car Price Prediction model** using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**, and **Random Forest Regression**.  
It is fully developed and deployed in **Google Colab** for reproducibility.

ðŸ‘‰ **Project Description:** See [docs/DESCRIPTION.md](docs/DESCRIPTION.md)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- The dataset contains **car attributes** such as `year`, `mileage`, `engine size`, `fuel type`, etc.  
- Target variable: **Price** of the car.  
- Data should be uploaded to Colab or linked from a dataset repository (e.g., Kaggle).  
- Example dataset: [Kaggle - Car Price Prediction]([(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cp70OsspMBAPGrgnF-m4AsRGvmkKetwy?usp=sharing)])
